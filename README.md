# Exploring Container Query

Welcome to **Exploring Container Query**! This project is a dedicated playground where we delve into the world of Container Query, a novel addition to CSS that enables responsive design based on an element's size rather than just the viewport.

## About

Container Query is an exciting development in web design that allows us to create designs that adapt to the size of their containing element. This is a significant departure from traditional responsive design, where adjustments are made based on the viewport width. In this project, we'll unravel the concepts, techniques, and possibilities that Container Query brings to the table.

## How It Works

Major aspect of Container Query will be explored through individual files in this project. We'll experiment with different scenarios, examining how styles change as the container's size varies. By doing so, we'll gain insights into this innovative feature and learn how to harness its potential for crafting more adaptive and flexible designs.
